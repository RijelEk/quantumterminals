But that sensation seems distant, as if reaching me through filter barrier that cuts off all extra frequencies, leaving only a faint echo of perception.  I never heard music, of course.  But the feeling is so real. Engine is rattling under the floor. Is it music? Train jerked and slowly begun to swing from side to side. We moved, alright, I said to myself with relief. I opened my eyes and looked at the window. Endless fields of pure untouched snow. No buildings, no people, a few trees and small wooden construction of unknown origin.  White is the colour of chasm. Everyone depict emptiness with back colour. Why is that? The emptiness is definitely white. "
